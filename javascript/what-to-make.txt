GAME STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS:

1. User initiates the GAME
2. Game generates a random 5-letter word to guess. //SCRIPTED
3. Keyboard begins to accept input (via typing or clicking). //SCRIPTED
4. User then makes a guess (must be full-length worth).
5. Game compares the guess against the 5-letter word.
6. Output is handled (letters change colour, keyboard changes colour, game ends if user wins or exceeds 6 guesses).
7. Game ends.
